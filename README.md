# Computer-Vision-Nightime Surveillance Object detection and Tracking
The project aims to develop a robust object detection and tracking system specifically designed for nighttime conditions using infrared thermal images captured by UAVs. Traditional visible-light cameras struggle in low-light environments, making surveillance and monitoring during nighttime or in poorly lit areas challenging. This project leverages the unique capabilities of infrared imaging to reliably detect and track various objects such as people, bicycles, cars, and other vehicles in diverse scenes, including schools, parking lots, roads, and playgrounds.

# Dataset:

The HIT-UAV dataset is used, which includes 2898 infrared thermal images extracted from 43,470 frames captured by UAVs. The dataset covers various scenes such as schools, parking lots, roads, and playgrounds, under different lighting conditions, including day and night.

# Challenges:

- Infrared images lack the color and texture features typically used in visible-light image processing, making it more challenging to distinguish between different objects.
- Nighttime conditions introduce additional difficulties such as high noise levels and reduced contrast, requiring specialized preprocessing and model adaptation.
